The interaction between a browser and a server is really quite astounding, when it comes down to it. With out even knowing it, an internet user enacts a complex series of commands just to access a sinmple web page. If my mother were to access my blog site, "miriahpeterson.com", she should start by typing the url into her chrome browser on her ipad. The chrome browser accepts this request and creates the URL. This URL is used to accesses the DNS to locate the specific IP address for the server location. Using specific protocols called Transmission Control Protocols and Internet Protocols (commonly refered to as TCP/IP) the sends a Hyperxt Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message to the server's IP address. 

The HTTP message requests that the server sends a copy of the site to the browser. If everything works correctly and the server is accessed it sends the "Status: 200 ok" message and sends small bits of information to the browser to it can build the user interace commonly recognized and the home page to my blog. Other HTTP codes may be send back my the server alerting the browser that it will be unable to display the page. Other HTTP response codes could be sent in response by the server which include redirection codes (300s), client side error (400s), and server side error (500s).
