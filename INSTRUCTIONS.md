## Networking Report
Write a 1-2 paragraph summary of what happens between a browser and server when a web request is made. Go into as much detail as you want. Feel free to do research to understand how all of this works if you find gaps in your knowledge.



## Data Structures
Write a 1 paragraph summary of 2 different data structures of your choosing. Give an example of when to use each type.

## sorting
In any language you want, write a script and include it such that it can sort a list of dates with the format MM-DD-YYYY

You'll want the script to take in, from the command line, a list of dates and then sort them. You can print them to standard out.
